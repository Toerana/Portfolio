- Real-time GPS tracking
- Display current location on a map
- View location history
- Fetch address details for coordinates
- MQTT integration for real-time updates

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/live-gps-tracker.git
    cd live-gps-tracker
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) to view the live GPS tracker.
2. To view the location history, navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/history/](http://_vscodecontentref_/1).

## MQTT Configuration

The project uses MQTT for real-time communication. The MQTT client is configured in the [mqtt_client.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/2) file. You can change the MQTT broker and topic as needed.

```python
MQTT_BROKER = "test.mosquitto.org"  # Change for production
MQTT_TOPIC = "gps/coordinates"      # Set the topic
